# Searchee: Search Shopee Review

Searchee is a free web application built with React.js and Flask which aims to help consumers determine better products by searching the reviews of their desired Shopee products.

On the web, browsing the reviews is not very accessible since you can only view 5 reviews at a time before clicking next page. Furthermore, there might be thousands of reviews which consumers need to go through, many that contains unnecessary information and spammy texts.

## Usage
```sh
npm i
npm start
```

Please note that you'll need the backend server that'll fetch data from `https://shopee.sg/api/v2/item/get_ratings`. You may contact me for more information.

## TODO
* Revamp to be used locally (able to cache data and search all automatically)
